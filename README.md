# Juno College Cohort 49 - Project 1

## The objective: 

Add JS functionality* to desktop, tablet and mobile versions of a previously converted static multi-page PSD*

*The design and assets were provided by Juno College. 
*JS functionality is up to the student. 

## Technical wins: 
- Created a mobile navigation that slides in when the hamburger menu is click on. 
- Created a dropdown feature for the top nav cart that resets the cart number to 0. User is asked to confirm before cart is set to 0.
- Created a quantity field for each shop product that updates both the product quantity count and the top nav cart whenever the + and - buttons are pressed.  

## Design liberties taken: 

- redesigned shop buttons in shop product containers
