# Juno College Cohort 49 - Project 1

## The objective: 

Add JS functionality* to desktop, tablet and mobile versions of a previously converted static multi-page PSD*

*The design and assets were provided by Juno College. 
*JS functionality is up to the student. 

## To-do:
- Only the first element in the product section acts exactly the way it should. Method forEach() needs to be implemented to iterated over every item in the shop. 
- Switch from onclick to event listeners.
- Convert code needing innerHTML with createElement and appendChild

## Technical wins/challenges: 
- Created a mobile navigation that slides in when the hamburger menu is click on. 
- Created a full functioning shopping cart app

## Design liberties taken: 

- redesigned shop buttons and containers in the shop product section.
