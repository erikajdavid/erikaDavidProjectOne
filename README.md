# Juno College Cohort 49 - Project 1

## The objective: 

Add JS functionality* to desktop, tablet and mobile versions of a previously converted static multi-page PSD*

*The design and assets were provided by Juno College. 
*JS functionality is up to the student. 

## Technical wins/challenges: 
- Created a popup modal with email submission error handling.
- Created a mobile navigation that slides in when the hamburger menu is click on. 
- Created a fully functioning shopping cart app for the home page. 

## Design liberties taken: 

- Redesigned shop buttons and containers in the shop product section. 
- Designed popup modal and cart app. 

## References used:
- Cart basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcrypywtAm0&t=2013s
- Mobile Menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFKBep95lb4&t=316s

## To-do:
~~- Only the first element in the product section acts exactly the way it should. Method forEach() needs to be implemented to iterated over every item in the shop.~~
~~- Switch from onclick to event listeners.~~
- Convert code needing innerHTML with createElement and appendChild

## On-going bugs
- Both the close cart icon and continue shopping link in the shopping cart only work for the shopping cart on the home page, and not the contact page.
